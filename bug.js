This bug occurs when using Tailwind CSS with PurgeCSS or similar tools.  If you have a component that conditionally renders elements, and those elements contain Tailwind CSS classes, PurgeCSS might remove those classes because they appear unused in the initial HTML render. This happens even if they become used later due to conditional rendering. For example:

```javascript
function MyComponent() {
  const [showElement, setShowElement] = useState(false);

  return (
    <div>
      <button onClick={() => setShowElement(!showElement)}>Toggle</button>
      {showElement && <div className="bg-red-500 p-4">This element is conditionally rendered</div>}
    </div>
  );
}
```

If PurgeCSS runs before the element is shown, it removes `bg-red-500` and `p-4` because they're not present in the initial HTML.
